# Pizzeria üçï
Project developed to the Harvard CS50 exercise [Homepage](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/tracks/web/homepage/) which objective was to improve my HTML and CSS abilities. 

The idea was to create a responsive website to a fictional pizzeria with the Home, About, Menu and Contact pages.

## How to run
To run the project you can simply download it and open any of the HTML files.
